          <strong>The short version:</strong> The IPRL lets you publish open-source code
          while explicitly reserving ownership of the intellectual property for future use as
          founder's capital — should a company ever be formed around the project. The code stays
          free; your IP doesn't evaporate into the commons.
        </div>

        <h2>The problem it solves</h2>
        <p>
          Founders at the pre-company stage face an uncomfortable dilemma. Open source is the
          right default — it builds trust, attracts contributors, and lets the community verify
          what you're building. But standard open-source licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) are
          designed for projects, not startups. They say nothing about IP ownership and
          implicitly treat it as irrelevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          When investors, co-founders, or lawyers enter the picture, the question of who owns
          the intellectual property in that early open-source code becomes very real — and
          often messy. The IPRL addresses this before it becomes a problem.
        </p>

        <h2>What the IPRL does</h2>
        <p>
          The license does two things simultaneously:
        </p>

        <div class="feature-list">
          <div class="feature-item">
            <div class="feature-icon">&#10003;</div>
            <div>
              <strong>Grants open-source freedoms</strong>
              <p>
                Anyone can use, study, modify, and redistribute the software. This part is
                equivalent to a permissive open-source license. No usage restrictions.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <div class="feature-icon">&#128273;</div>
            <div>
              <strong>Reserves IP ownership explicitly</strong>
              <p>
                The license explicitly states that intellectual property rights — patents,
                trademarks, trade secrets, and the rights to commercialise the work — are
                reserved by the named author(s). Using the software does not transfer or
                license these rights.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>When this matters</h2>
        <p>
          The typical scenario: a solo founder or small team builds something in the open,
          builds a community around it, then reaches the point of incorporating a company.
          Without IP documentation, the company formation process can get complicated —
          who contributed what, does the open-source license affect the company's ability
          to monetise, do contributors have implicit claims?
        </p>
        <p>
          The IPRL makes the IP situation unambiguous from day one. Contributors know what
          they're working with. Potential co-founders and investors have a clean paper trail.
          The founder's contribution has a recorded value.
        </p>

        <h2>What it doesn't do</h2>
        <p>
          The IPRL is not a business-source license or a "source available" restriction.
          It doesn't limit how anyone uses the software. It doesn't require payment or
          attribution beyond standard attribution. It doesn't prevent forks.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also isn't a substitute for proper legal advice when you're actually forming a
          company. Think of it as a documented starting position — not a complete legal structure.
        </p>

        <h2>Using the IPRL</h2>
        <p>
          The license text is freely available. To apply it to your project, include it as
          <code>LICENSE</code> in your repository, filling in the author name(s) and date.
          Add the standard header comment to your source files.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scratcher Project uses the IPRL for all its projects during the pre-incorporation phase.
