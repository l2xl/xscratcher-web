        <h2>Where this came from</h2>
        <p>
          The Scratcher Project started from a familiar frustration: the best tools for trading and
          managing crypto are either closed-source, SaaS-subscription products you can't fully trust,
          or raw APIs that require writing your own glue code every single time. Neither is great.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal here is to build the open-source middle ground — proper applications, not scripts.
          Things with real interfaces, real reliability, and source code you can actually read and verify.
        </p>

        <h2>What "The Scratcher Project" means</h2>
        <p>
          Scratching the surface usually signals that you've barely started. We think that's a feature,
          not a bug. The best work happens when you're still curious, still questioning the obvious
          assumptions, not yet locked into the first solution you tried.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project deliberately stays in that mode: building incrementally, shipping early,
          and staying open to rethinking things when they're not working.
        </p>

        <h2>Open source, for real</h2>
        <p>
          Everything here is open source. Not "open core" where the useful parts cost money.
          Not "source available" with a license that prohibits commercial use. Actually open —
          MIT or equivalent, forkable, auditable, buildable by anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          For crypto tools specifically, this isn't just a philosophy. It's a basic trust requirement.
          You shouldn't run closed-source software that handles your private keys or executes your trades.
          Open source is the only way to verify what's actually happening.
        </p>

        <h2>The intellectual property question</h2>
        <p>
          Building open source doesn't mean giving everything away forever with no path to sustainability.
          The <a href="iprl.html">IP Reserve License</a> is our attempt to solve this honestly —
          keeping code open during the pre-company phase while preserving the IP as a foundation for
          whatever comes next. It's an approach we're sharing with anyone in the same position.
        </p>

        <h2>Get involved</h2>

          The projects are early. If any of this resonates — whether you want to contribute code,
          test things, write docs, or just follow along — reach out.
