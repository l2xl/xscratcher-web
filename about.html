        <h2>What is The Scratcher Project?</h2>
        <p>
          The Scratcher Project is a personal startup focused on building practical tools
          and frameworks for people who make things — designers, developers, writers,
          and anyone else who spends their days turning ideas into reality.
        </p>

        <h2>The idea behind the name</h2>
        <p>
          "Scratching the surface" usually means you've barely started. We think that's
          exactly the right place to be: curious, exploring, not yet locked into a single
          answer. The Scratcher Project is built around that spirit of early-stage thinking
          — the phase where possibilities are still wide open.
        </p>

        <h2>What we're building</h2>
        <p>
          We're starting small and iterating fast. Our focus is on tools that reduce
          friction in the creative process — things that let you spend more time doing
          and less time wrangling with your environment.
        </p>
